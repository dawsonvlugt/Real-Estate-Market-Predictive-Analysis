# Real Estate Market Predictive Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to predict real estate prices using machine learning models. We analyze a dataset of 2,930 home sales to identify trends and factors influencing property values. Check out the [Exercise 9 Project Code](projectCode.py) for the complete source code.


## Objectives
- To preprocess and analyze a large real estate dataset.
- Compare the effectiveness of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models in price prediction.
- Optimize model parameters for improved accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **Plotly** for data visualization
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning models

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python and required libraries (pandas, Plotly, scikit-learn) are installed.
3. Run the main script: `python real_estate_analysis.py`
